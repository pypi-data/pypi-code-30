               right_boundary=None, frac=0.3, delta=0.01):
    """
    Opinionated convenience wrapper for lowess smoothing.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x, y : np.ndarray
        The x and y values to fit, respectively.
    logx, logy : bool
        Pass True to perform the fit on the scale of ``log(x)`` and/or
        ``log(y)``, respectively.
    left_boundary, right_boundary : float, optional
        Allows specifying boundaries for the fit, in the original ``x`` space.
        If a float is passed, the returned fit will return the farthest left or
        farthest right lowess-estimated ``y_hat`` (from the original fitting
        set) for all points which are left or right of the specified left or
        right boundary point, respectively.
    frac : float
        The lowess smoothing fraction to use.
    delta : float
        Distance (on the scale of ``x`` or ``log(x)``) within which to use
        linear interpolation when constructing the initial fit, expressed as a
        fraction of the range of ``x`` or ``log(x)``.

    Returns
    -------
    function
        This function takes in ``x`` values on the original ``x`` scale and
        returns estimated ``y`` values on the original ``y`` scale (regardless
        of what is passed for ``logx`` and ``logy``). This function will still
        return sane estimates for ``y`` even at points not in the original
        fitting set by performing linear interpolation in the space the fit was
        performed in.

    Notes
    -----
    No filtering of input values is performed; clients are expected to handle
    this if desired. NaN values should not break the function, but ``x`` points
    with zero values passed when ``logx`` is True are expected to break the
    function.

    Linear interpolation between x-values in the original fitting set is used to
    provide a familiar functional interface to the fitted function.

    The default value of the ``delta`` parameter is set to be non-zero, matching
    the behavior of lowess smoothing in R and improving performance.

    Boundary conditions on the fitted function are exposed, mostly as a
    convenience for points where ``x == 0`` when fitting was performed on the
    scale of ``log(x)``.
